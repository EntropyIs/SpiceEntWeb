								<p>Spice of Life Entertainment is a local Australian business formed in 2003.  Originally, it was formed as a backyard mobile disco company to cater primarily to birthdays and weddings in the greater Melbourne area.  (Primarily the northern suburbs.)</p>
								<p>Shortly after, the company diversified into the nightlife and entertainment industry propper and hosted a number of events around Melbourne in a variety of popular night spots as well as taking appropriate, but diverse spaces and adapting them to host nightlife events.</p>
								<p>Having hosted a number of local Dj's and producers, Spice of Life Entertainment took the scope of their business one step further a decade later and launched as an online music label hosting artists such as Anti-P.L.U.R, Naked Age, A.T.K, Wolf Dynasty and Old Men's Grooves to name a few.</p>
								<p>Spice of Life Entertainment grew a few years later by opening two new sub labels.  House Music Melbourne and All Access EDM. </p>
								<p>Now, Spice of Life Entertainment does all this and more, including hosting a weekly online radio show which airs in the UK, providing music for indie game projects and is currently in the process of expanding into other endeavours which for now must remain under lock and key secrecy!</p>
								<p>In all its endeavours, Spice of Life Entertainment has always prided itself on 3 key ideologies:</p>
								<ol>
									<li>Variety is the Spice of Life.</li>
									<li>Moderation and balance in all things.</li>
									<li>Quality over quantity and Substance!</li>
								</ol>
								<p>Spice of Life Entertainment has endured a long journey over the past 20+ years and can confidently and honestly say that although the company has never achieved commercial success, it has achieved so much more by being a unique place for creative minds, self expression and the best music you've never heard!</p>
